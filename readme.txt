Welcome to the ungraded lab for week 2 of Machine Learning Engineering for Production. The paradigm behind Deep Learning is now facing a shift from model-centric to data-centric. In this lab you will see how data intricacies affect the outcome of your models. To show you how far it will take you to apply data changes without addressing the model, you will be using a single model throughout: a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While training this model the journey will take you to address common problems: class imbalance and overfitting. As you navigate these issues, the lab will walk you through useful diagnosis tools and methods to mitigate these common problems.
